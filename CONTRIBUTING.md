### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: areas where coding is required
- **qa-needed**: Questsions and Answer section is required
- **documentation-needed**: support us finding gramer issues, making new topics, and update the documetantion
- **bug-high-priority**: discover and raise bug warning for critical bug issues
- **bug-low-priority**:  discover and raise bug warning for low bug issues
- **help-wanted**: 

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
